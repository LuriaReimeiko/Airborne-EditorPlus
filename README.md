# **Editor+**
A large overhaul of the editor in order to make creating levels more bearable while Bl4ck is working on the rewrite.

## QnA :
```
Q : Will you update this for the rewrite ?
A : I have no plans to.

Q : Can I contribute to this mod ?
A : You are welcome to do so by joining the official Discord server, which is available on the game's Steam page.


Q : Will you add "x" feature ?
A : You are free to ask in the Discord, but probably not.
```

## Ending Note
This mod is made by myself during my free time as a passion project to support the development of the game Airborne by Bl4ck and xDev.

This mod does not and will not modify any aspect of gameplay in any way, it doesn't even enable its code if you are outside of the editor.
